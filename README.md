# Design

The overall design is a retro aesthetic inspired by the Apple IIc. The games are generated on a "board" on each individual page and wrapped in this style to meld them together as a collection.

## Colour

There are three main colours featured across the website - green, black and off-white. These are based on the Apple IIc's green phosphorous display and it's casing.

## Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the Press Play 2P font to style.css. This is the only font used on the website as it is the only font available on Google Fonts that is reminiscent of the bitmap font used on on the Apple IIc.

## Buttons and Links

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created in Balsamiq.
